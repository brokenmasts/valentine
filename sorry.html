        Ahhh, this day. IT was so abrupt tooo. Like we were just you know being normal after our fight and were
        healing. and i still remember the exact place. My bus stop is the third in the line . So im PRETTY
        sure between the 2nd and 3rd bus stop ( we were walking to my bus stop for some reason), you abruptly
        stopped and hugged me tight. I legit was so clsoe to crying. I'll never forget this. I love you so so much
        babyy.
