<h2>Slammed Doors, Passionate Confessions </h2>

<pre style="font-size: larger;">
     I still remember this day like yesterday. I was so scared and anxious. I could already not imagine my
     life without you. I'm not a very loud or expressive person but i still remember how i was arguing with
     you right in front of the college. Oh and that phone call in a crowded bus....That day i was even more
     certain that you were the one for me and i would do anything for you. I love you so so much baby.
